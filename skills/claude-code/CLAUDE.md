# Project Context — Sigma Computing Agentic Workspace

This workspace builds Sigma Computing dashboards/workbooks via Claude Code using Sigma's official agent skills plus project-local workbook-pattern skills.

## Session kickoff

The skill opens with a 3-question `AskUserQuestion` gate on the user's first
build-related message (explicit trigger: `start build mode`). Questions cover
`.env` state, data source, and what/where to build. On `.env`-yes, `bash
scripts/api/_env.sh` warms the token cache and `scripts/api/whoami.sh`
actively validates auth against the live API before recon starts. Then Recon
→ Plan → User approval → POST → GET → Visual verify. **Plan approval is the
only authorization for state-changing API calls.**

**Transcript-first entry point.** If the trigger is a pasted call transcript,
or a request to build off a named call/account, start with
`.claude/skills/initial-call-brief/` instead of jumping straight to the
3-question gate — it extracts a structured brief (business context, data
specifics, Open Decisions) and gets that approved first. Its "Suggested
workbook goal" then becomes the input to the normal `.env`/data-source
questions and Recon → Plan flow below. Never skip straight from a raw
transcript to spec authoring.

If the user wants to add project-specific enrichments (Tableau migration
notes, account-specific patterns, etc.) directly to the skill, the
convention is a **`local-` filename prefix** on added files (e.g.
`reference/local-tableau-migration.md`) so opt-in additions stay visually
separable from canonical content. See SKILL.md → "Optional: session-local
enrichment via `local-` prefix."

Full 3-question text and workflow details live in
`.claude/skills/sigma-workbook-conventions/SKILL.md` → "Session kickoff."

## Skills loaded here

**Upstream (via plugin marketplace, see `.claude/settings.json`):**
- `sigma-api` — OAuth → bearer token; provides `get-token.sh`. Use whenever the user wants to call the Sigma REST API.
- `sigma-data-models` — Round-trips data model specs (sources, columns, metrics, relationships, filters, controls, folder groupings, column-level security).

**Project-local (`.claude/skills/`):**
- `initial-call-brief` — turns a pasted or looked-up (Gong, via `scripts/api/mcp-search.sh` + `scripts/api/mcp-query.sh`) sales call into a structured brief, always paused for approval, before anything downstream runs. **This is the new front door** for "here's a call, build me a workbook" — start here whenever the request references an actual customer conversation rather than a cold ask.
- `sigma-workbook-conventions` — input resolution, naming, layout, control catalog, and POST-time gotchas when generating workbook specs. Carries **load-bearing rules** (passthrough mandatory, `[Metrics/<Name>]` resolution + DM-switch hard rule, formulas trace to recon, controlId/column collision) plus a chunked `reference/` split under `specification/` (per-element files: `schema`, `charts`, `kpis`, `tables`, `controls`, `layout`, `formulas`, `formatting`, `sources`, `sources-warehouse`, `text`, `containers`, `others`, `maps`) and `workflows/` (`plan`, `crud`, `validate`, `discover`, `from-image`), plus top-level rules (`conventions`, `naming`, `scope-and-edge-cases`, `history`). Pair with `scripts/sigma-resolve.py` (resolver) and `scripts/validate-spec.py` (pre-POST validator — 13 checks; full catalog in `reference/workflows/validate.md`).

**Required reading before authoring (HARD GATE).** Before drafting a plan or writing any spec JSON in build mode, `Read` the chunk files mapped to the task type in `.claude/skills/sigma-workbook-conventions/SKILL.md` → "Required reading before authoring." Plans must include a `Chunks Read:` line listing the files consulted. Plans without that line are not approvable. This gate was added 2026-05-19 after a cold-start test session authored two workbooks without ever opening the chunk files — see `.claude/skills/sigma-workbook-conventions/reference/history.md` → "2026-05-19 — Cold-start test session."

Domain-specific workbook-pattern skills (revenue, ops, fin-recon, etc.) get added under `.claude/skills/` as separate folders once we have 2–3 working exemplars to anchor a pattern on. See `docs/skill-authoring.md`.

A read-only mirror of the upstream skills lives at `vendor/sigma-agent-skills/` for inspection while authoring new project skills. Refresh with `scripts/refresh-vendor.sh`.

## Sigma documentation lookups via native MCP

When you need a Sigma formula function reference (`Sum`, `DateDiff`,
`Rollup`, etc.) or a REST API endpoint shape, use the native
`mcp__claude_ai_Sigma_Docs__*` tools instead of `WebFetch`:

- `mcp__claude_ai_Sigma_Docs__search` — keyword search across help docs
- `mcp__claude_ai_Sigma_Docs__fetch` — fetch a docs page by id
- `mcp__claude_ai_Sigma_Docs__list-endpoints` / `get-endpoint` /
  `search-endpoints` — Sigma REST API reference

No auth, no bash, no permission prompts when allowlisted. Schemas load
via `ToolSearch` on first use. Already allowlisted in `.claude/settings.json`.

**Sigma_Docs MCP is a Claude.ai account-level connector, not a Claude Code
plugin.** If the customer running this repo hasn't enabled it in their
Claude.ai account, the `mcp__claude_ai_Sigma_Docs__*` tools won't appear.
Fallback: use `WebFetch` against `https://help.sigmacomputing.com/` (function
references) and `https://help.sigmacomputing.com/reference/` (REST API
endpoints). The skill works without the MCP — most function syntax is
already in `.claude/skills/sigma-workbook-conventions/reference/specification/formulas.md`;
the MCP is a faster lookup for unfamiliar functions.

Workspace discovery (finding workbooks/data models), data-model
inspection, and workbook authoring/publishing all use the bash helpers
in `scripts/api/`. See `.claude/skills/sigma-workbook-conventions/SKILL.md`
for the workflow.

## Authentication

1. `cp .env.example .env` and fill in `SIGMA_BASE_URL`, `SIGMA_CLIENT_ID`, `SIGMA_CLIENT_SECRET`.
2. Done — scripts in `scripts/api/*.sh` self-bootstrap on first call (load
   `.env`, fetch token via the `sigma-api` skill, cache at `/tmp/.sigma_token`
   with a 55-min TTL). No env-prelude or token chaining needed from the caller.
3. If your `get-token.sh` lives somewhere other than `~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/sigma-computing/...`, set `SIGMA_TOKEN_FETCHER` to its path.
4. **Never echo `$SIGMA_API_TOKEN`, `$SIGMA_CLIENT_SECRET`, or any other secret.** Don't write secrets to files inside the workspace. Pass tokens only via `Authorization` headers.

## Layout

- `workbooks/<name>/` — one folder per dashboard. Each contains `spec.json`, `prompts/<timestamp>.md`, `iterations/<timestamp>.json`, `notes.md`. Start a new dashboard by copying `workbooks/_template/`.
- `workbooks/_exemplars/` — golden specs harvested from Sigma. Read-only references; never edit.
- `scripts/api/` — auth-bootstrapped wrappers around Sigma's MCP server (`mcp-search.sh`, `mcp-describe.sh`) and REST endpoints (`find-file-by-urlid.sh`, `list-folders.sh`, etc.). Each sources `_env.sh` on first call to load `.env` and cache an OAuth token. Workbook CRUD (POST/PUT to `/v2/workbooks/*`) still goes through direct `curl` — no helper script yet.
- `scripts/load-env.sh` — used internally by `_env.sh`. Direct callers rarely need it. `scripts/refresh-vendor.sh` clones the upstream skill repo into `vendor/` for inspection only.
- `prompts/library/` — reusable prompt fragments (guardrails, framing, etc.).
- `docs/` — `conventions.md`, `iteration-playbook.md`, `skill-authoring.md`.

## Iteration loop (summary; full playbook in `docs/iteration-playbook.md`)

1. Save the prompt verbatim to `workbooks/<name>/prompts/<timestamp>.md`.
2. Save the generated/edited spec to `workbooks/<name>/iterations/<timestamp>.json`.
3. Diff against the closest exemplar; record findings in `notes.md`.
4. When a fix recurs across 2+ iterations, promote it into the relevant skill's `reference/` or `examples/`.
5. Commit each iteration so `git log` becomes the iteration log.

## Authoring new workbook-pattern skills

See `docs/skill-authoring.md`. Pattern mirrors Sigma's own: `SKILL.md` with sharp frontmatter description, `reference/` split by functional domain, `examples/` with at least one known-good spec.
